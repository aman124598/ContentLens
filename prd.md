PRD.md – AI Reply Filtering Chrome Extension
1. Product Overview

Product Name (Working Title): AI Reply Filter
Platform: Google Chrome Extension
Category: Content Analysis / Productivity / Web Enhancement

Concept Summary

AI Reply Filter is a Chrome extension that analyzes textual content on web pages and estimates the likelihood that specific replies, comments, or messages were generated by AI systems. The extension assigns a confidence score (1–10 scale) to detected text blocks and enables users to hide, blur, or highlight content based on a configurable threshold.

The system does not claim definitive AI detection; instead, it provides probabilistic, heuristic-based assessments.

2. Problem Statement

With the proliferation of AI-generated content across forums, social platforms, and discussion spaces, users increasingly encounter:

Low-effort or generic AI replies

Automated bot-like responses

Reduced signal-to-noise ratio

Difficulty assessing authenticity

Users lack lightweight, user-controlled mechanisms to filter or visually distinguish likely AI-generated text.

3. Goals & Objectives
Primary Goals

Provide AI-likelihood estimation for visible text content

Allow user-controlled filtering via confidence thresholds

Improve browsing experience by reducing unwanted content

Maintain privacy and transparency

Secondary Goals

Offer explainability for scores (future versions)

Support multiple websites

Provide non-intrusive UI integration

4. Non-Goals

The product will not:

Guarantee accurate AI detection

Perform user surveillance or identity tracking

Modify server-side content

Replace moderation systems

5. Target Users
Primary Users

Users overwhelmed by AI-generated spam/replies

Researchers / analysts studying content patterns

Productivity-focused users

Communities sensitive to bot-generated content

Secondary Users

Educators / students

Moderators (informational use)

Curious general users

6. Core Value Proposition

AI Reply Filter provides a probabilistic AI-style signal estimator that helps users manage content exposure without making unverifiable claims of authorship.

7. Key Features
7.1 Text Detection & Extraction

Description

The extension scans visible web page content to identify candidate text blocks such as:

Comments

Replies

Posts

Message bodies

Functional Requirements

Detect dynamic DOM updates

Exclude input fields & UI elements

Ignore extremely short text

Efficient traversal & extraction

7.2 AI-Likelihood Scoring

Description

Each detected text block receives a score on a 1–10 scale representing AI-style confidence.

Interpretation Example

Score Range	Meaning
1–3	Highly human-like variability
4–6	Ambiguous / mixed signals
7–8	Strong AI-style indicators
9–10	Highly AI-like statistical profile

Important Constraint

Scores represent heuristic/statistical similarity, not proof of AI origin.

7.3 Threshold-Based Actions

Users can define a confidence threshold controlling behavior:

Modes

Hide content

Blur content

Highlight content

Show score badge only

7.4 Popup Control Panel

Components

Master toggle (ON/OFF)

Threshold slider (1–10)

Mode selector

Domain controls (whitelist/blacklist)

7.5 Settings / Options Page

Default threshold

Per-site configuration (future)

Privacy preferences

Exclusions

8. User Experience
8.1 Default Behavior

Extension enabled

Text analyzed in background

Scores applied silently

UI adjustments based on threshold

8.2 Visual Indicators

Possible UI elements:

Small badge near replies

Hover tooltip with score

Soft visual styling (non-disruptive)

8.3 User Control Philosophy

No automatic aggressive filtering

User-defined thresholds

Clear transparency

11. Privacy & Data Handling
Principles

No persistent storage of raw text

Hash-based caching preferred

Explicit disclosure of data flow

Domain exclusions for sensitive sites

User Concerns Addressed
